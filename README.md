# IOT-WITH-JS

To start coding with Arduino you need a Arduino UNO board which is good for beginners

We will use Jhonny-five as a JS library to code for Arduino
Before starting with Jhonny five we need to set up our board. Follow the below steps
1. connect board to one of the port
2. Login/signup to Arduino https://store.arduino.cc/digital/create use web editor to flash the board
3. open web editor and select the board 'Arduino UNO' port will be detected automatically
4. go to examples and go to 'From Libraries' > 'FIRMATA' > standardFirmata
5. verify the code and upload it to board
6. Your board is now ready.

Now clone this repository and follow the below steps
1. After cloning repo use 'npm install'
2. after the dep are installed now connect the led to board and execute the files which ever is needed
blink.js is basic and keypress.js is to operate led with keyboard arrow keys
